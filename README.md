+ *Pre- Processing*: Contains code to combine the bayarea dataset provided by mentor and the WARN notices, and cleaning the combined dataset with string manipulation, logical subsetting etc, before the dataset is ready for ML training

+ *ImportantCSVs*: Contains all datasets we worked with for prescriptive modeling. 

+ *Models*: Contains all ML models we implemented throughout the semester, including but not limited to preditions of layoff profiles and extracting the driving factors behind layoff events  .  

+ *Python Notebooks for Visiualizations*:  Contains all code to generate EDAs, descriptive modelling and time-series analysis

+ *Reports and Miscellaneous*: Contains the initial exploration reports drafted during the beginning of semester for documenting the reserach progress

+ *Visiualization*: Contains Tableau visiualization that summarizes our findings by the low-tech demo date 


We also published summary of our analysis & findings on [website](https://ieor135project.wixsite.com/website) as the UI for the project.
